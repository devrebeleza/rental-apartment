### Ideas to expand on this project

- Implement a dashboard for the administrator that you can deploy to a separate hosting or even run locally to give you data about bookings and earnings
- Let people add information about how many guests will be there, and save this information in the database
- Add a checkbox if people have pets
- Think about how to add a way for people that registered to leave a review once they end their stay
- Add discounts for week or monthly stays (7 or 30 days+)
- Add service fee at the end of the stay
